		This is my first attempt at creating a particles effect in c++<br/>
		It's fixed-step dependent, but can be made dynamic easily.
		In this system, particles are supposed to be created in random positions within a certain area, called "generator".
		You can set the base values for various particles properties, as well as an offset which will be used to randomize
		each single particle.
	</p>
</div>
<div class = "box text">
	These are the properties which can be customized:
	<ul>
		<li>Size scale (both x and y)</li>
		<li>Base speed</li>
		<li>Acceleration/deceleration over time</li>
		<li>Lifetime (in steps)</li>
		<li>Direction</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Each property can have an offset which will used to randomize values.
		For example, if base speed is 10, and the offset is 2, the particle generator will
		create particles which speed is equal to 8-12 units per step.
