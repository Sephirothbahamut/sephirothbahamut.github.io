			<div class="box">
				<p>
				The purpose of advanced getilne is to make a c++ getline feel like a regular textbox to the user.<br/>
				That means the user will be able to move the cursor, highlight text, overwrite, access memory of previous
				inputs, delete parts of the text, and various other things.<br/>
				Moreover the developer can further customized getline's colors to make them fit the console in case the

			<h2> Current State </h2>
			<div class="box">
				The program is almost completed in the Windows version, although it still lacks some functionality like
				insert and copy-paste.
				Linux version is almost ready to be added to the repository but it's not there yet.
				The current version, despite lacking some functionalities, is already fully usable and i'd like people to actually
				use it and maybe report existing bugs i didn't find.
