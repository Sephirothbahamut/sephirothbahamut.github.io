	The purpose of advanced getilne is to make a c++ getline feel like a regular textbox to the user.<br/>

<h2> Current State </h2>
<div class="box">
	The program is almost completed in the Windows version, although it still lacks some functionality like
	insert and copy-paste.
	Linux version is almost ready to be added to the repository but it's not there yet.
	The current version, despite lacking some functionalities, is already fully usable and i'd like people to actually
	use it and maybe report existing bugs i didn't find.
