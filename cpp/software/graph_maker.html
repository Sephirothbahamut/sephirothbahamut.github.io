	<p>
		This work in progress remake of my older Game Maker software found <a href="/game_maker/software/graph_maker">here</a>.
	</p>
</div>
<h2> Completed project features </h2>

<div class="box"">
	<p>
	GraphMaker is a program which lets you build simple graphs, (oriented, non-oriented or even mixed) with ease.
	</p>
	<p>
	The whole program revolves around a dynamic graph data structure which can be loaded/saved, altered, and used to test algorithms (more on that later). The dynamic graph also allows users to save and load custom variables into both nodes and arcs.
	</p>	
	<p>
	This version, unlike the one made on Game Maker, has both a CLI mode and a GUI mode. It is possible to freely switch between the two at runtime and keep working on the same graph (the loaded graph is there regardless of what mode is being used).
	</p>
	<h3> CLI Mode </h3>
	<p>
	The CLI mode supports a custom C-like scripting language (a subset of the C++ grammar), using which the user can interact with graphs through functions and classes that are built in the scripting language. (Yes, i actually found it more interesting to write a C-like parser and interpreter than to just support lua scripts). </br>
	For instance, in CLI mode it is possible to write a cycle to create N nodes and connect them to each other.
	</p>
	<h3> GUI Mode </h3>
	<p>
	The GUI mode will let the user do <b>most</b> of the things possible through the command line. The main advantage is visualizing the graph in your screen with all nodes and variables (you can actually chose which variables will be shown graphically, and hide the rest).
	</p>
</div>
<div class="box"">
	<h3> Algorithms Testing </h3>
	<p>
	The biggest feature of Graph Maker, which is the reason i translated the whole program to C++ and wrote an interpreter, is allowing users to test custom algorithms and visually see (if GUI mode is being used) how the algorithm navigates through a graph. Algorithms will be a special type of script written in the same mentioned language but with some constraints (for instance, a "visit" function must be defined that takes a node as an argument). When running the algorithm, Graph Maker will take care of colouring arcs and nodes per each "visit" call accordingly to what's going on.
	When an Algorithm is completed in both GUI and CLI mode, a vague esteem of its complexity is shown (still thinking about how to do that).
