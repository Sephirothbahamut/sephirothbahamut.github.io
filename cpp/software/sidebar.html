	<p>
	As the name suggests, this software is strictly Windows only, Linux version is not planned.
	</p>
	<p>
	Windows SideBar is an highly customizable desktop tool, which adds a bar on the right side of the screen.
	The bar has an analog clock, which Windows 10 lacks of by default, and a customizable amount of buttons.
	</p>
	<p>
	The buttons can either run a program, open a website, or even run a console command.
	</p>
	<p>
	Colors can be customized.
	</p>
	<p>
	By default an additional decoration is active which renders some nice particle effects behind your taskbar;
	if you don't see the particles, you have to enable taskbar transparency.
