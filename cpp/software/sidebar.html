	As the name suggests, this software is strictly Windows only, Linux version is not planned.
	</p>
	<p>
	Windows SideBar is a desktop tool which adds a bar on the right side of the screen; it can hold an analog clock, which Windows 10 lacks of by default, and an undefined amount of buttons.
	</p>
	<p>
	The buttons can either run a program, open a website, or even run a console command, and colors can be customized.
	</p>
	<p>
	SideBar is made with optimization in mind, it will take as few memory and cpu usage as possible. Since it's meant to be fast and performant i thought it wasn't the case to add a scrolling bar in order to let you add more links than your screen would allow. Also battery impact on laptops is minimal.
	</p>	
	<p>
	Everything is customizable, colors, space between buttons, density of the background effect, animations speeds. Just make it be as you want it to be!
