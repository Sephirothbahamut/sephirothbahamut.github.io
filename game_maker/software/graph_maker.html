	<p>
		This project is likely to be abandoned. I'm working on a new version in C++ with more features which would be
		unnecessairly harder to do with game maker. You can find more about C++ version <a href="/cpp/software/graph_maker">here</a>.
	</p>

<h2> Content and Features </h2>

<div class="box"">
	<p>
	GraphMaker is a program which lets you build simple graphs, (oriented, non-oriented or even mixed) with ease. (on bottom a video showing BFS after 22/02/2017 update)
	</p>
	<p>
	All of program functionalities are 100% completed, but as you may notice, top-bar and left-bar excluded, the user interface is not much "cured" and only features default look. Since the GUI library is going to get substantial modifications during my future revision, GraphMaker's aesthetics will remain in stand-by till the new (hopefully good enough to be published) version of the gui will be released. Then the very first thing i will do is updating GraphMaker using that version, which grants improved performances to the software itself, and i will give it some more cured aesthetics as well.
	</p>
	<p>
	Please if you can test the program and let me know of any bug, especially during the visits simulations (providing .grph file of the graph giving error messages if you can)
