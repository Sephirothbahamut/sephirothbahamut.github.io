				Hi, I'm Michael Marchesan looking forward to work in game development.
				<br />
				I've always dreamed about making games, from the gameplay design and story, to the core building blocks, be it code, cards, or anything else.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my classical studies highschool I started exploring Game Maker, which was my first experience with programming. And I loved it.
				This passion giuded my university choice towards Computer Science where I discovered C++, which I liked enough I decided to study it in more depth during my free time,
				to the point I was recently asked to take part as teacher to an advanced C++ extracurricular course.
			</p>
			<p>
				Programming aside, I'm a huge Tolkien fan, and studying his works led me into worldbuilding and writing. In the last 12 years I've created and refined my own fantasy world, with its own history, language, legends, and cultures;
				I was also an HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) practitioner and historical reenactor, before Covid arrived at least.
				My Game Designer side had to mix all my other passions and bring out an overcomplicated result, and I ended up designing my own Tabletop RPG system with rules realistic enough to reflect my HEMA experience while still being enjoyable, coding automated character sheets for that ruleset, and then master a campaign with those rules set in my fantasy world.
			</p>
			<p>
				My largest interests are in the two extremes of Game Development: on one side, I love the intricacies behind engine development, on the other I really like worldbuilding, storywriting and designing game mechanics.
			</p>

			<br/>
			<p>Currently I'm working on Unreal Engine 4.27 for a digital effects for cinema company as sole developer, in particular I'm working on an extension to UE's Virtual Camera plugin, and I'm helping integrate their existing Linux infrastructure with Windows/WSL and Unreal Engine.</p>
