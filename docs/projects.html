							<h4>Golfzier</h4>
							<h5>C# / Unity Game</h5>

						<toggle-content>
							<p>
								A Videogame developed for my Computational Geometry course exam. It's a golf game that uses Bezier surfaces for terrain generation and manipulation.
								The player moves the ball by modifying the terrain.

							<p>
								Documentation and prototype for a theoretical game made for an university exam. It's a turn based tabletop-like multiplayer game, with some social elements
								and with real time puzzles between each turn, which have side effects in the ongoing match.

							<h4>CPP_Utilities</h4>
							<h5>C++20</h5>
						</toggle-button>
						<toggle-content>
							<p>
								A collection of C++ utility classes and functions, under the namespace "utils". It contains data structures, standard containers cout, coloured cout (on Windows only), mathematical utilities like a vec2 class, angles and transforms, an asynchronous logger and much more.
								<br />
								In my first attempt to make a 2D game engine, I started collecting some classes on the side, together with some other utilities I found out I kept reusing in my code in different projects.
								When I finally scrapped the game engine, I decided to keep some of the data structures written for it.
								The collection grew over time, to the state of today; I'm still actively adding funcitonality to it.
								I'm particularly proud of my <a href="https://github.com/Sephirothbahamut/utils/blob/master/include/utils/tracking.h">tracking_ptr</a>, a smart observer pointer which never loses its target, even when that target moves in memory.

							<h4>Incredibly Inefficient Game Engine</h4>
							<h5>C++17 / SFML</h5>
						</toggle-button>
						<toggle-content>
							<p>
								Hopefully not as inefficient as the name suggests, this is my third attempt to make a 2D engine from scratch, cumulating what I've learnt with the previous 2 versions.
								It's far from being finished, and I doubt I'll ever finish it; still I enjoy working on it and feel like it's a nice learning process.
								Plus it gives me plenty of chances to ask smart (hopefully) questions to C++ pros.

								In the current version I'm still undecided about which direction to go for colliders; I'm considering limiting the engine to few shapes, no arbitrary polygon,
								and moving collision detection to CUDA.

							<h4>Plotter</h4>
							<h5>C++17 / C# / C++CLI / SFML / LibreHardwareMonitorLib</h5>
						</toggle-button>
						<toggle-content>
							<p>
								Tired of monitoring software that is flat looking, lacks dark themes, and/or only shows plots in tiny little areas, I decided to make my own resource monitor.
								The looks are extremely customizable, but getting started is a bit slow.
								You first have to get a list of the hardware IDs of your machine that are supported by LibreHardwareMonitorLib (output on console when Plotter is launched).
								Then you need to create a script which defines your UI. "Plotter_data.txt" is the one working on my machine, and it's fully commented, giving all the
								information needed to modify it to fit your own machine.
								TODO Github readme.

							<h4>Graph Maker</h4>
							<h5>C++ / SFML</h5>
						</toggle-button>
						<toggle-content>
							<p>
								A program I made originally in Game Maker to have a simple visualization of algorithms during my algorithms and data structure course at university.
								As it usually happens with me, it exploded in features.
								<br />
								Now it is a Graph editor and visualizer, with file inport and export, plus AngelScript support that lets users run completely arbitrary algorithms written in
								AngelScript on the currently loaded graph. Properly written navigation algorithms will not only run on the graph, but also show in real time with color changes and lines
								animations how the graph is being visited.
								<br />
								Originally I planned writing an interpreter for an ad-hoc C-like language for the purpose, together with a course mate. We started it, but stopped when we arrived at implementing classes in our language.
								I've then decided to switch to AngelScript. Our old parser is in the "Craph" project mentioned later.

								A gravitational n-body simulation which compares performance between CPU in sequential mode, CPU in parallel mode, GPU in parallel without smem, and GPU in parallel with smem.

							<h4>Image Viewer</h4>
							<h5>C++17 / SFML</h5>
						</toggle-button>
						<toggle-content class="box">
							<p>
								Since Windows 10's built in photo viewer takes ages to load, and all the image viewers I could find came with some unnecessary fluff, I said "fine, I'll do it myself".
								It doesn't do anything fancy at all. It just opens pictures, zooms in and out, scrolls to next and previous files, and lets you drag the image on the window.
								I'm planning making it a borderless draggable window, so that everything of the space it takes is dedicated to displaying the picture, no borders, no bars.

								A sidebar for windows that auto-hides, with an analog clock (I can't live without one), fancy particles in the background, window transparency,
								and which can fit an arbitrary amount of buttons with custom labels and actions.

							<h4>Craph</h4>
							<h5>C++17</h5>
						</toggle-button>
						<toggle-content>
							<p>
								A definitely unfinished and unpolished attempt at making a C-like language interpreter. It was an experiment I started with a coursemate years ago, but regardless of the outcome, it was a worthy learning process.
								The few things that are implemented (local variables, scopes, function declarations, return copy, pass by copy and pass by reference) all work fine; we stopped before adding classes because the complexity was exploding.
